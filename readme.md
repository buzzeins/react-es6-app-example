React ES6 Browser Sync
===
This is a simple example app that pulls information from a github user account from a username.  It is built using the following tools:

1. [React in ES6](https://github.com/facebook/react)
2. [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) for rendering ES6 and JSX to JS
3. [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to run the build and watch processes
4. [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) for fun
5. [Browser Sync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync) to speed up development
